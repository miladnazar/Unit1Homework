Unit 1 Homework Assignment: FinTech Case Study
*Hello this is Milad Nazar. I am an working on my first Homework here and I want to study FinTech so I can build a solution or substittue for Billing/Payments.*
## Overview and Origin

* **Who are the founders of the company?**
Patrick Collison, and John Collison (Brothers)
* **How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?**
Businesses didn't have any large scale online payment solutions so Stipe came up with solution for payments between businesses. Eventhough PayPal was available but PayPal was famous for payments between people not so much businesses.

In May 2011, Stripe received a $2 million investment from venture capitalists Peter Thiel, Sequoia Capital, and Andreessen Horowitz. Stripe launched publicly in September 2011 after an extensive private beta.

## Business Activities:

**What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)**

PayPal is one of their competitors who accepts payments from users in over 200 countries. Stripe only accepts payments from users in 25 countries. PayPal can only process 25 currencies whereas Stripe has an advantage of processes over 135 currencies.

*Currently, PayPal accepts payments through the following methods:*

1. PayPal
2. PayPal Credit
3. Credit cards
4. Debit cards
5. Pay by phone

*If that restriction in payment types worries you, then you may prefer using Stripe that accepts a vast array of payment types, including:*

1. Credit cards
2. Debit cards
3. International cards
4. AmEx Checkout
5. Masterpass by MasterCard
6. Visa Checkout
7. WeChat Pay
8. AliPay
9. Apple Pay
10. Google Pay
11. ACH credit and debit

If you’re just in need of a simple payment processing solution, PayPal’s minimal integrations might be all that you need. Specifically, PayPal integrates with platforms like WooCommerce, QuickBooks, and Salesforce. E-commerce, accounting, and CRM–that’s really all some businesses may need.

*The most famous method of payment for the past 50-10 years is called Pay by Link*
* When we talk about Pay By Link we are referring to a method of payment that greatly simplifies the sending and receipt of an economic amount to pay a service or for the purchase of a product.
As its name suggests, it consists of sharing a link through the social network that best suits your needs – whether Facebook, Skype, Twitter, Instagram, mail or WhatsApp among others – and is valid for any model of mobile phone -Android or iPhone-. You can send it by email or include the link in the same budget or invoice.
* Luckily for everyone, Pay By Link is not a method that is limited to any specific case, in fact, it is quite the opposite. There are many freelancers who use it to educate their clients in the simplest way possible. This is to facilitate the payment process to avoid delays and other unnecessary problems. It is also used by those companies that are based on their social networks, such as Facebook or Instagram, as they do not have any physical store or any online store.

They measure success by remaining a step ahead of the millions of organizations that use Stripe every day so they can help them scale and succeed for their success.
